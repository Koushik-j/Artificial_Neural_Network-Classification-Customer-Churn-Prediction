# Artificial_Neural_Network-Classification-Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Introduction

Customer churn prediction predicts the likelihood of customers canceling a company’s products or services. In most cases, businesses with repeat clients or clients under subscriptions strive to maintain the customer base. Therefore, it is important to keep track of the customers who cancel their subscription plan and those who continue with the service. This approach requires the organization to know and understand their client’s behavior and the attributes that lead to the risk of the client leaving.

## Why Predict Customer Churn?

It is important for any organization dealing with repeat clients to find ways to retain existing ones. The approach is crucial since customer churn is expensive, and acquiring new clients is more expensive than retaining existing ones. Consider an internet service (ISP) provider who has acquired a new user. They will need technicians and hardware to connect the latest client to their service. The client will only be required to pay the subscription fee to continue using their plan. If the user fails to renew their service, the company will most likely be at a loss, especially if the trend continues for several customers. The monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for such an institution will likely be low; hence, it will be unable to sustain the business. Thus, a reliable churn prediction model should help companies stay afloat as they scale up and attract more customers.
